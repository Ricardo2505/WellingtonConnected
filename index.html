				<h3>The ears</h3>
				<p>Routers are the ears of internet. Routers are the ones in charge of letting the internet know all what the user needs. If an user needs a picture of cat, their computer would be connected to a router, which will tell the internet that it needs to find a picture of a cat.   </p>

				<h3>The arms</h3>
				<p>Wire boxes are the arms of the internet. If we imagine wires as veins, these boxes contain thousands of wires that transport information all around the place until it arrives to its final destination.</p>

				<h3>The eyes</h3>
				<p>Cameras are the eyes of the internet. Cameras are constantly sending images in real time to one or several computers. These computers are at the same time connected to the internet, so we would not be wrong claiming that the internet is watching everything... all the time.</p>

				<h3>The guts</h3>
				<p>Manholes are the guts of the internet. Manholes are there, on the ground, we can not see what it is inside them, but they are there. Manholes contain several wires and spoeceific infrastructures that help information going to one place to another. However, if something weird happens, a technician would have to explore the guts of the internet and fix the problem from the inside. </p>
